Pair trading is a statistical arbitrage strategy that involves trading a long position in one asset against a short position in another asset in the same market or sector. The idea is that these two assets will move in tandem over time, but if their prices become misaligned, the trader can profit by buying the underpriced asset and selling the overpriced asset.

Here is an outline for a pair trading script:

Select a pair of assets to trade. This could be done manually, or you could use a market analysis tool to identify pairs with a high degree of co-movement.

Download historical price data for the two assets. You will need a sufficient amount of data to calculate the statistical relationship between the two assets.

Calculate the spread between the two assets. This is typically done by subtracting the price of one asset from the price of the other.

Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the spread. These statistics will be used to determine when the spread is significantly different from its historical norm.

Implement a trading rule. For example, you might buy the underpriced asset and sell the overpriced asset when the spread is more than two standard deviations below its mean, and vice versa.

Backtest the strategy. Use your historical price data to see how the strategy would have performed in the past. This will give you an idea of the potential risks and returns of the strategy.

Implement the strategy in real-time. Once you are satisfied with the results of your backtest, you can use the script to trade the pair in real-time. Be sure to use risk management techniques, such as setting stop-loss orders, to protect against potential losses.
